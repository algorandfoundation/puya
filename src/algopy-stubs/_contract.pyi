        When declaring a Contract subclass, options and configuration are passed in
        the base class list:

        ```python
        class MyContract(algopy.Contract, name="CustomName"):
            ...
        ```

        :param name:
         Will affect the output TEAL file name if there are multiple non-abstract contracts
         in the same file.

         If the contract is a subclass of algopy.ARC4Contract, `name` will also be used as the
         contract name in the ARC-32 application.json, instead of the class name.

        :param scratch_slots:
         Allows you to mark a slot ID or range of slot IDs as "off limits" to Puya.
         These slot ID(s) will never be written to or otherwise manipulating by the compiler itself.
         This is particularly useful in combination with `algopy.op.gload_bytes` / `algopy.op.gload_uint64`
         which lets a contract in a group transaction read from the scratch slots of another contract
         that occurs earlier in the transaction group.

         In the case of inheritance, scratch slots reserved become cumulative. It is not an error
         to have overlapping ranges or values either, so if a base class contract reserves slots
         0-5 inclusive and the derived contract reserves 5-10 inclusive, then within the derived
         contract all slots 0-10 will be marked as reserved.

        :param state_totals:
         Allows defining what values should be used for global and local uint and bytes storage
         values when creating a contract. Used when outputting ARC-32 application.json schemas.

         If let unspecified, the totals will be determined by the compiler based on state
         variables assigned to `self`.

         This setting is not inherited, and only applies to the exact `Contract` it is specified
         on. If a base class does specify this setting, and a derived class does not, a warning
         will be emitted for the derived class. To resolve this warning, `state_totals` must be
         specified. Note that it is valid to not provide any arguments to the `StateTotals`
         constructor, like so `state_totals=StateTotals()`, in which case all values will be
         automatically calculated.
