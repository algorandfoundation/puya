### Changed

- Removed automatic output of ARC-32 app spec files. 
  ARC-32 has been marked for eventual deprecation, with ARC-56 as the replacement. 
  ARC-56 app spec files are already automatically output and continue to be.
  To continue outputting an ARC-32 file, specify the command line option `--output-arc32`.
