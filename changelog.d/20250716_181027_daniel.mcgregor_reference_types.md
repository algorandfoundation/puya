### Added

-   Added a PuyaPy CLI option and `@abimethod` argument `resource_encoding` that controls how
    resource types (`algopy.Asset`, `algopy.Application` and `algopy.Account`) are handled in the
    ABI router.
    When set to `value` (the default) the types will use their underlying value type (`uint64` or `address`).
    When set to `index` the types will use their ARC-4 reference aliases and when calling
    require populating the appropriate foreign array.
    This affects TEAL, AVM bytecode, ARC-32 and ARC-56 file output.

### Changed

-   The default behaviour for the new `resource_encoding` option is different to prior versions, resource
    types (`algopy.Asset`, `algopy.Application` and `algopy.Account`) will now appear as their underlying
    ARC-4 value types in ABI methods (`uint64` and `address`).
    This affects TEAL, AVM bytecode, ARC-32 and ARC-56 file output.
