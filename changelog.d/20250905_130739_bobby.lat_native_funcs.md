### Removed

- A bullet item for the Removed category.

-->

### Added

-   Add `.as_uint64()` and `.as_biguint()` methods for all `arc4.UIntN` and `arc4.BigUIntN` classes to convert them to the primitive values. `.as_uint64()` works even for types with bytes size > 64 such as `BigUIntN[typing.Literal[128]]`, `BigUIntN[typing.Literal[512]]`, .etc, as long as the actual value fits within the bound of uint64. `.as_uint64()` throws overflow error if the value is larger than uint64

<!--
### Changed

- A bullet item for the Changed category.

### Deprecated

-   `.native` property in `arc4.UIntN` and `arc4.BigUIntN` classes has been depreacted. Use `.as_uint64()` or `.as_biguint()` instead.

<!--
### Fixed
