<!--
### Removed

- A bullet item for the Removed category.

-->
### Added

- Added `algopy.FixedArray` that supports mutable, native and dynamic elements in an array with a fixed size.
- Added `algopy.Struct` that supports mutable, native and dynamic members.
- Added `.to_native(element_type)` function for converting `algopy.arc4.DynamicArray` to `algopy.Array` and `algopy.arc4.StaticArray` to `algopy.FixedArray`. 

### Changed

- `algopy.Array` can now be used in storage and allows native, mutable and dynamically sized types, 
   however it no longer has reference semantics and may require `.copy()` when aliasing the array or it's contents.

   To retain the original behaviour of `algopy.Array` use the new `algopy.ReferenceArray` type. 

-  Require `.copy()`when extending or concatenating a sequence containing mutable values to maintain idiomatic compatability.
